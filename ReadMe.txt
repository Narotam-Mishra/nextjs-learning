# Next JS is full stack React framework, builds on top on Reactjs.

# It vastly simplifies the process of building fullstack applications with React.

# The main problem React App is that search engine crawlers don't see the actual page content if they visit the page for the first time and that's the difference with Nextjs. In Nextjs, we used to get all content not just visually on the screen but in the actual source code, because in Nextjs we no longer have a client-side application. Instead we have a full stack application.

# Page Router & App Router :- Both are simply two different ways of building NextJS apps.

# Page Router - It has been around for many years and is very stable. It is used in many existing NextJs projects that allow us to build feature-rich fullstack apps with React.

# App Router - It is intoduced in NextJS 13. Marked as stable but still realatively new and partially buggy. It supports modern Next & React features (fullstack React apps). The future of NextJS.
